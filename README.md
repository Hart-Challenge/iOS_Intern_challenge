# Hart iOS_Intern_challenge



The included Xcode project contains a .json file that is a list of Disney movie objects that include the movie title, the rating, the length and the the year the movie was made. Use this .json file to build an app that does the following:


* Display the movie object titles in a UITableView.

* Build a feature that sorts the movie objects based on their titles in alphabetical order (A->Z) and reverse alphabetical order (Z->A).

* Build a feature that filters movies based on their rating.

* Build a feature that filters movies based on their release date (ex. filter out movies before 1994, filter out movies between 1960 - 1980)

**Bonus:** Include a search bar that will allow the user to search for a movie title.

All the sorted and filtered lists mentioned above should display in the tableview. The UI for triggering the filtering or sorting is completely up to you.

The challenge must be completed in 30 mins
